Timeliness, also called currency or freshness, measures the degree to which data represents current 
reality and meets required availability timeframes. LakeFSInformatica DAMA defines it as "the degree to which 
data represent reality from the required point in time," emphasizing that timeliness requirements vary dramatically 
based on use caseâ€”from microseconds in high-frequency trading to weeks for strategic planning.
